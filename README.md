# Supervised-Machine-Learning-tutorials

- In this folder I have handpicked key concepts for supervised machine learning tasks. 
- The tasks include both regression as well as classification. 
- Each concept have been illustrated using a python code which has been partially or majorly modified from the source sites. The latter has been mentioned explicitly as references at the end of the each jupyter notebook carrying .ipynb extension.
