# Supervised-Machine-Learning-tutorials

- In this folder I have handpicked key concepts for supervised machine learning tasks. 
- The tasks include both regression as well as classification. 
- Each concept have been illustrated using a python code which has been partially or majorly modified from the source sites or references. 
- The references are mentioned at the end of the each jupyter notebook carrying .ipynb extension.
